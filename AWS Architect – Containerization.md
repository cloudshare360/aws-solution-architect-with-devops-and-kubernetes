 Strategic Learning Plan: AWS Architect – Containerization

🔧 Deepen EKS & Kubernetes Knowledge

You’ve got Docker and entry-level Kubernetes exposure. Let’s elevate that into expert-level orchestration.

Learn: Kubernetes networking, RBAC, Helm charts, monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana), GitOps (ArgoCD).

Do: Set up production-grade EKS cluster with multiple namespaces, CI/CD integration.

Resources:

AWS EKS Workshop

Kubernetes The Hard Way by Kelsey Hightower

Udemy: Kubernetes Hands-On – Deploy Microservices

O'Reilly: Kubernetes Patterns

Educative.io: Kubernetes for Developers

Coursera: Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine

📦 Master ECS & Fargate Deployment Models

You're well-versed in container fundamentals—now go deep into service options.

Learn: ECS launch types (EC2 vs. Fargate), service discovery, ALB integration.

Do: Implement microservices in both ECS and Fargate, compare autoscaling and cost-efficiency.

🧱 Design Reusable Patterns

As an architect, reusable blueprints are key.

Learn: Designing task definitions, service configurations, scaling policies.

Do: Create CloudFormation or CDK templates for standardized ECS/EKS/Fargate deployments.

Resources:

O'Reilly: AWS CloudFormation Mastery

Coursera: AWS CloudFormation Deep Dive

🔐 Secure & Optimize Container Environments

AWS expects security and performance baked into every solution.

Learn: IAM roles for tasks, secrets management (SSM & Secrets Manager), image scanning (Amazon Inspector, ECR scanning).

Do: Benchmark container startup times, memory footprints, and throughput with K6 or Locust.
